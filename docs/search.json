For this model, you can use any of the three options above, or you may use:\n\nA linear or binary logistic model fit using a Bayesian engine, or\nA weighted linear regression model.\n\n\n\nNeed Help?\nQuestions about Project B may be directed to the TAs and to Professor Love at any time after your submission of the Project A portfolio in March. If you’re asking a question on Campuswire, please use the Project B label, and we encourage you to ask general questions in public rather than privately, so as to get help from other students, and provide help to them."

    "text": "Hint for Question 2\nThe modeling approaches we’ve worked on for count outcomes can be finicky, at least in comparison to OLS. Sometimes, you’ll get to the point where it seems like the model won’t run, or won’t summarize properly, or you have some extremely large or extremely small coefficient estimates or standard errors. Should this happen to you, the first thing we would do is try to identify which of your predictors is causing this problem, by running the model first with one predictor, then two, etc. until you figure out which predictors cause problems. Reasons why you could be having a problem include:\n\na predictor has values that completely identify the category of your outcome variable, perfectly (e.g., one category’s predictor values are inevitably lower than all of another category’s predictor values, with no overlap)\nthe scales of the predictors are wildly different, for instance one predictor has extremely large or extremely small values, causing the estimated standard errors to explode, which should cause you to think about reducing the impact of that, perhaps by changing the units, say from $s to $1000s or by normalizing the predictors\nintense collinearity between two or more of your predictors\ncoding issues in setting up one or more of the variables."

While we have not provided a specific template for this Lab, we encourage you to adapt the one provided for Lab 2.\n\n\nQuestion 1. (10 points)\nThis question uses the oh22 data developed in Lab 1. See the Lab 1 instructions for details on the data set. Back in Lab 1, recall that we loaded the data with this code.\n\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = NA)\n\noh22 &lt;- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/432-data/master/data/oh_counties_2022.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE) |&gt;\n  clean_names() |&gt;\n  mutate(fips = as.character(fips))\n\nUse the oh22 data to create a logistic regression model to predict the presence of a water violation (as contained in h2oviol) on the basis of sev_housing and pm2.5. Use a model with main effects only, and annotate your code with text so that it’s extremely clear what you are doing. Specify and then carefully interpret the estimated odds ratio associated with the sev_housing effect and a 90% confidence interval around that estimate in context using complete English sentences. Be sure to get the direction of the effect right in your modeling and description.\n\n\nQuestion 2. (10 points)\nBegin with the hbp3456 data we developed in Lab 2, but now restricted to the following four practices: Center, Elm, Plympton and Walnut, and to subjects with complete data on the ldl and statin variables. We will use these data (which should now include 1446 rows of data) for Questions 2-5 in this Lab.\nBuild a logistic regression model to predict whether a subject seen in one of those four practices has a statin prescription based on:\n\nthe subject’s current LDL cholesterol level\nwhich of the four practices they receive care from, along with\nthe subject’s age.\n\nFit two models: one with and one without an interaction term between the practice and the LDL level. Include the age variable in each model using a restricted cubic spline with four knots, but without any interaction with the other predictors. Display the coefficients of your two models.\n\n\nQuestion 3. (10 points)\nFor the “no interaction” model from Question 2, interpret the odds ratio associated with the ldl main effect carefully, specifying a 90% confidence interval and what we can conclude from the results.\n\nTo obtain a 90% confidence interval with a fit using one of the rms fitting functions rather than the default 95% interval, the appropriate code would be summary(modelname, conf.int = 0.9).\nHint: We assume you will describe the ldl main effect by considering the case of Harry and Sally. Harry has an ldl value of 142, equal to the 75th percentile ldl value in the data. Sally has an ldl value of 85, equal to the 25th percentile ldl value in the data. Assume Harry and Sally are the same age and receive care at the same practice. So the odds ratio of interest here compares the odds of statin prescription for Harry to the odds of statin prescription for Sally.\n\n\n\nQuestion 4. (10 points)\nNow using the “interaction” model from Question 2, please interpret the effect of ldl on the odds of a statin prescription appropriately, specifying again what we can conclude from the results. A detailed description of the point estimate(s) will be sufficient here.\n\nHere, we want you to describe the ldl main effect by considering the case of Harry and Sally. Harry has an ldl value of 142, equal to the 75th percentile ldl value in the data. Sally has an ldl value of 85, equal to the 25th percentile ldl value in the data. Assume Harry and Sally are the same age and receive care at the same practice. So the odds ratio of interest here compares the odds of statin prescription for Harry to the odds of statin prescription for Sally. But now, you need to be able to do this separately for each individual level of practice, since practice interacts with ldl. There are at least two ways to accomplish this.\n\nIn one approach, you would create predicted odds values for Harry and Sally, assuming a common age (40 would be a reasonable choice, and it’s the one used in the answer sketch) with ldl set to 142 for Harry and 85 for Sally, but creating four different versions of Harry and Sally (one for each practice.) Then use those predicted odds within each practice to obtain practice-specific odds ratios.\nIn the other approach, you could convince the rms package to use a different practice as the choice for which adjustments are made. By default, datadist chooses the modal practice. To change this, you’d need to convince datadist instead to choose its practice based on which practice is the first one, and relevel the practice factor accordingly. So, if you’d releveled the practice data so that Elm was first and placed that into a tibble called dataelm, you could use the following adjustment to the datadist call to ensure that the adjustments made by datadist used Elm instead of the modal practice.\n\n\n\nd_elm &lt;- datadist(dataelm, adjto.cat = \"first\")\noptions(datadist = \"d_elm\")\n\n\n\nQuestion 5. (10 points)\nNow, compare the effectiveness of your two fitted models (the “interaction” and “no interaction” models) from Question 2 and draw a reasoned conclusion about which of those two models is more effective in describing the available set of observations (after those without statin data are removed) from these four practices. An appropriate response will make use of at least two different validated assessments of fit quality. Be sure to justify your eventual selection (between the “interaction” or “no interaction” model) with complete sentences.\n\nThe natural choices for validated assessments of fit quality in Question 5 are a bootstrap-validated C statistic and a bootstrap-validated Nagelkerke \\(R^2\\). In the answer sketch, we will use 2023 as our random seed for this work, and we’ll use the default amount of bootstrap replications.\n\n\n\nOur Best Advice\nReview your HTML output file carefully before submission for copy-editing issues (spelling, grammar and syntax.) Even with spell-check in RStudio (just hit F7), it’s hard to find errors with these issues in your Quarto file so long as it is running.

To be eligible for the study, a subject had to meet all of the following criteria:\n\nhave an EHR-documented hypertension diagnosis which applied during the one-year reporting window,\ncared for at one of the eight practices in this study, and by one of the 62 participating providers in this study\nage 25 or older at the start of the one-year reporting period (note that all subjects with ages 80 and higher are listed as age 80 in the data)\nbetween 1 and 12 primary care office visits in the one-year reporting period\nbetween 2 and 24 primary care office visits combined across the reporting period and the previous year\nfall into one of two biological sex categories (female or male)\nfall into one of four primary insurance categories, specifically Medicare, Commercial, Medicaid or Uninsured.\nhave a most recent systolic BP between 80 and 220 mm Hg and most recent diastolic BP between 40 and 140 mm Hg, where the systolic BP is at least 15 and no more than 130 mm Hg larger than the diastolic BP.\n\n\n\nCodebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nrecord\nunique code for each subject (six digits, first digit is 9, last indicates practice)\n\n\npractice\nprimary care practice, of which there are eight in the data\n\n\nprovider\nprimary care provider (each practice has multiple providers)\n\n\nage\nsubject’s age as of the start of the reporting period\n\n\nrace\nsubject’s race (4 levels: Asian, AA_Black, White, Other)\n\n\neth_hisp\nis subject of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity?

A subject with a current prescription for any of these will have a Yes in bp_med.\nFor the acearb, betab, bpmed, statin and depr_diag variables, a No response includes all subjects where there’s no evidence in the EHR of meeting the Yes criterion, so that there are no missing values (a missing value is interpreted there as No.)\nFor the height, weight and ldl results, implausible values were treated as missing in preparing the data for you.\nThe race and eth_hisp values are self-reported, and some subjects refused to answer one or both of the relevant questions.\nThe income and hsgrad values are imputed from the subject’s home address, usually at the census block level, but occasionally at the level of the zip code.\n\nWhen a subject’s home address could not be geocoded, these values are noted as missing.\nGeocoded estimates of income below 6500 are reported as 6500, and estimates above 130000 are reported as 130000.\nFor hsgrad, geocoded estimates below 40 are reported as 40, and estimates above 99.9 are reported as 99.9."

To get help in this course, you have three main options:\n\nUse our Campuswire discussion board to ask (and answer) questions about the course. This is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Campuswise. Sign up for Campuswire via the email you received on 2024-01-12 at your CWRU email.\nAttend TA office hours to get one-on-one help or share a computer problem. TA office hours are held via Zoom, and will begin on XXXXXX, and continue through XXXXX, except for Spring Break (no office hours March 9-15.)\n\nThe schedule for TA office hours will be posted here when it becomes available.\nZoom information to join these sessions will be posted to our Shared Drive when available.\n\nEmail Professor Love at Thomas dot Love at case dot edu with any individual concerns related to the course that you do not feel comfortable asking elsewhere, or if you have any special concerns or needs that you want him to know about, or to set up an appointment with him for a Zoom meeting.\n\nProfessor Love will also hold “drop in” hours for a few minutes before and as long as necessary after each class in our classroom."

Note that you’ll have to do something so that your work focuses on the comparison of Highland to Sycamore, leaving out (for this question only) the other practices.\nYou’ll have to deal with some missing values in the data. All missing values are indicated in the .csv file with NA. It’s not usually appropriate to report results that include imputation in a Table 1, so build a note specifying the amount of missing data in a footnote to the table. An appropriate approach would be to produce a list just below your Table. Do not impute for Question 1.\nSome variables will present as characters in the data, but you’d instead prefer them to appear as factors. Be sure to include code in your response to make these changes (the forcats package is your friend here) and then (perhaps using the fct_relevel function in the forcats package) be sure to move the levels of those factors into an order that facilitates interpretation.\nBe sure, too, to make reasoned choices about whether means and standard deviations or instead medians and quartiles are more appropriate displays for the quantitative variables. Include your reasons in a list displayed at the end of your table. Note that the record information is just a code (even though it is numerical) and should be treated as a character variable in using these data, as I did above.\nNote that body mass index (BMI) and BMI category are not supplied in the data, although you do have height and weight. So, you’ll have to calculate the BMI and add it to the data set. If you don’t know the formula for BMI, you have Google to help you figure it out.\nFor BMI categories, use the four groups specified in the How is BMI interpreted for Adults section of this description of Adult BMI by the Centers for Disease Control. Again, you’ll need to use your calculated BMI values and then create the categories in your data set, and you’ll need to figure out a way to accurately get each subject into the correct category.\nDo not include R output without complete sentences describing what you are doing in each step, and what you conclude from that work."
