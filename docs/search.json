To get help in this course, you have three main options:\n\nUse our Campuswire discussion board to ask (and answer) questions about the course. This is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Campuswise. Sign up for Campuswire via the email you received on 2024-01-12 at your CWRU email.\nAttend TA office hours to get one-on-one help or share a computer problem. TA office hours are held via Zoom, and will begin on XXXXXX, and continue through XXXXX, except for Spring Break (no office hours March 9-15.)\n\nThe schedule for TA office hours will be posted here when it becomes available.\nZoom information to join these sessions will be posted to our Shared Drive when available.\n\nEmail Professor Love at Thomas dot Love at case dot edu with any individual concerns related to the course that you do not feel comfortable asking elsewhere, or if you have any special concerns or needs that you want him to know about, or to set up an appointment with him for a Zoom meeting.\n\nProfessor Love will also hold “drop in” hours for a few minutes before and as long as necessary after each class in our classroom."

To be eligible for the study, a subject had to meet all of the following criteria:\n\nhave an EHR-documented hypertension diagnosis which applied during the one-year reporting window,\ncared for at one of the eight practices in this study, and by one of the 62 participating providers in this study\nage 25 or older at the start of the one-year reporting period (note that all subjects with ages 80 and higher are listed as age 80 in the data)\nbetween 1 and 12 primary care office visits in the one-year reporting period\nbetween 2 and 24 primary care office visits combined across the reporting period and the previous year\nfall into one of two biological sex categories (female or male)\nfall into one of four primary insurance categories, specifically Medicare, Commercial, Medicaid or Uninsured.\nhave a most recent systolic BP between 80 and 220 mm Hg and most recent diastolic BP between 40 and 140 mm Hg, where the systolic BP is at least 15 and no more than 130 mm Hg larger than the diastolic BP.\n\n\n\nCodebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nrecord\nunique code for each subject (six digits, first digit is 9, last indicates practice)\n\n\npractice\nprimary care practice, of which there are eight in the data\n\n\nprovider\nprimary care provider (each practice has multiple providers)\n\n\nage\nsubject’s age as of the start of the reporting period\n\n\nrace\nsubject’s race (4 levels: Asian, AA_Black, White, Other)\n\n\neth_hisp\nis subject of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity?

A subject with a current prescription for any of these will have a Yes in bp_med.\nFor the acearb, betab, bpmed, statin and depr_diag variables, a No response includes all subjects where there’s no evidence in the EHR of meeting the Yes criterion, so that there are no missing values (a missing value is interpreted there as No.)\nFor the height, weight and ldl results, implausible values were treated as missing in preparing the data for you.\nThe race and eth_hisp values are self-reported, and some subjects refused to answer one or both of the relevant questions.\nThe income and hsgrad values are imputed from the subject’s home address, usually at the census block level, but occasionally at the level of the zip code.\n\nWhen a subject’s home address could not be geocoded, these values are noted as missing.\nGeocoded estimates of income below 6500 are reported as 6500, and estimates above 130000 are reported as 130000.\nFor hsgrad, geocoded estimates below 40 are reported as 40, and estimates above 99.9 are reported as 99.9."

    "text": "Project B Overview\nIn project B, you will create two research questions that can be addressed with data you can conveniently obtain that can be used to address each of your questions, with models that you learned in the 431-432 sequence.\nYou will fit one regression model for each research question.\n\nEach of your models must include 2-8 predictors.\nEach model must include at least one predictor that is not included in the other model.\nEach model will need to describe observations from the same pool of “subjects”, so that a single tibble services the whole Project.\n\nThe model for your first outcome must be either:\n\nA model for a multi-categorical outcome\nA model for a count outcome, or\nA Cox model for a time-to-event outcome with censoring\n\nThe model for your second outcome must use a different approach than you used for Outcome 1. For this model, you can use any of the three options above, or you may use:\n\nA linear or binary logistic model fit using a Bayesian engine, or\nA weighted linear regression model.\n\n\n\nNeed Help?\nQuestions about Project B may be directed to the TAs and to Professor Love at any time after your submission of the Project A portfolio in March.

These should be separated by a space or comma. Be sure to leave the Install dependencies box checked.\n\n\nA popup box may appear, asking “Do you want to install from sources the packages which need compilation?” to which I usually answer No. A Yes response leads to a slower installation, but can solve problems if you still have them after updating.\nThis may take a few minutes. As long as you’re seeing activity in the Console window, things are progressing.\nEventually, you’ll get a message that “The downloaded source packages are in …” with a directory name. That’s the sign that the updating is done."
