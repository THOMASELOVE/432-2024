# Project A Overview

In Project A, you will be analyzing, presenting and discussing a pair of regression models, specifically a linear regression and a logistic regression, describing a data set (available to the public) that you identify.

There are two main deliverables:

- The Project A Plan, due in mid-February
- The Project A Portfolio and Presentation, due right after Spring Break.

All Project A work is to be submitted [via Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/).

# Need Help?

Questions about Project A may be directed to the TAs and to Professor Love at any time after the start of the course. If you're asking a question [on Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/), please use the `Project A` label, and we encourage you to ask general questions in public rather than privately, so as to get help from other students, and provide help to them.
